<br/>

GraphQL is a query language that enables you to query your APIs and fetch specific data that you need. Using one endpoint, you can query just the data you want to retrieve and receive a JSON response containing that specific data. 

<br/>


#### Using GraphQL

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <Your Token>" -XPOST http://<server:port>/metadata/api/v1/query -d '{"query":"..." }'
```
