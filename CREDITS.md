This workshop borrows heavily from a similar [workshop](https://github.com/openshift-labs/lab-k8s-fundamentals) by the same author (Graham Dumpleton) which was developed while working for Red Hat. The current workshop is a refactoring of the prior workshop to use eduk8s. This workshop and the original workshop are both made available under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
